# UniFi Network Application - Go Voucher Generator

Origin Story: I recently deployed Ubiquiti access points in my home.I wanted to host a Guest Wi-Fi that was open and easy to join. However I didn't wanted to prevent people not visiting my home from using my internet. I created a button that, when pressed prints a small voucher code.

The is an open-source Golang library designed to interface with the UniFi Network Application dashboard, facilitating the automated generation and fetching of new vouchers for WiFi hotspot landing pages.

By enabling the programmatic generation of vouchers, this library broadens the scope for creating better guest Wi-Fi experiences.
